"Welcome Human", it says, "I see another one of your race is willing to accept the challenge for the worthy?" As you look confused at it, it continues talking "I see, so you do not know what this place is?" You nod in confusion. "Then let me explain. This is one of the gateway stations to the Arena of the Worthy. It was built by my kind the Impetus. Only the best individues of every species get to this place. It was built for them to compete in the art of combat. The rewards for winning are exceptional. If you want to compete go to the spaceport."`
